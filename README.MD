## Telecom Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

# Overview:

This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn in a telecom company. We leverage various data exploration techniques, visualization, and machine learning models to gain insights and develop predictive capabilities.

# Contents:

1. Introduction:

Overview of the project and its goals.

2. Data Exploration:

Quick check of data types and non-null values.
Statistical summary of numeric columns.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations to explore feature distributions.
Analysis of total charges and monthly charges.
Correlation analysis of selected features.

4. Churn Analysis:

Segmentation of customers based on tenure.
Cohort analysis to examine differences between customer segments.
Visualization of churn counts per cohort.

5. Predictive Modeling:

Implementation of four tree-based models: Single Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation of model performance using classification reports and confusion matrices.

6. Conclusion:

Summary of key findings and insights.
Comparison of model performance.
